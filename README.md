A Graphical visualiser of the Particle Swarm Optimisation algorithm  written in C++ and SDL

The aim of this program was just to visually see how the algorithm operates on a variety of mathematical benchmark functions.

The algorithm might not be entirely correct in finding some of the optimums, but the visual effect is cool.

The algorithm has the following dependances:

    __libsdl-dev__
    __libboost-dev__

To compile the source execute _make_ in the root of the directory. After compilation has completed with no errors, the algorithm can be started by executing _./gfxinterface_

As of 2013-04-20 the algorithm is Linux specific. Next order of business it to get it to run on Mac Os X
